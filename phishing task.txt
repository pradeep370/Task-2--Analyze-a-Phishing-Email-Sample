here i mentioned how did i find and what way i used

1. Generic Greeting
   - The email starts with “Dear Valued Customer” instead of using my actual name, which is common in phishing emails.

2. Fake Sender Email
   - The email was sent from a Gmail address (tomandcherry403@gmail.com), not an official domain like @yourbank.com. 

3. Urgent and Threatening Language
   - The message says Failure to verify within 24 hours will result in permanent suspension of your account, which creates unnecessary pressure and fear to make the user act quickly.

4. Suspicious Link
   - The link shown is: https://yourbank.secure-verify-login.net  
   - Although it appears secure, it’s not a legitimate domain.
   - Real banks never ask customers to click links in such emails.

5. Grammatical and Stylistic Issues
   - Sentences like ...suspended your access for security reasons and To restore access are slightly awkward and impersonal.
   - Some phrases are unnatural and lack the polish of a real company email.

6. Attachment Used to Steal Information
   - The email includes a fake PDF file titled **Account_Verification_Form.pdf** which is meant to collect sensitive details like ATM PIN, card number, and login credentials.
